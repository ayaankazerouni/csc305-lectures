In 1994, a group of four authors wrote what was to become a famous book about Design Patterns (titled *Design Patterns*). The book describes three broad classes of Design Patterns:

- Behavorial Patterns: identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns
- Structural Patterns: organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality
- Creational Patterns: provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way
